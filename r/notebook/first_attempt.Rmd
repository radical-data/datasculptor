## Goal

Goal: script that will take three numeric columns and output an obj file.

Most basic example: two independent variables (x,y) and one dependent variable (z, mapped to height).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
sculpture_points <- crossing(x = 1:10, y = 1:10) |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(z = runif(1)) |>
  ungroup()
```



```{r}
hi <- 
  rep(1:100, 4) |>
  as_tibble()
yes <- mutate(hi, points = sample(hi, 1))
```




```{r}
hi <- rep(1:100, 4) |>
  as_tibble()
rows <- sample(nrow(hi))
shuffled <- hi[rows, ]

shuffled |>
  mutate((row_number()-1) %% 3)
```


to make an .obj file, need to remove variable names and separate entries by a space.

```{r}
write_delim(x = sculpture, file = here::here("data/sculpture.obj"),
            delim = " ", col_names = FALSE, )
```
